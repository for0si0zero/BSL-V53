### Server ###

[I](https://github.com/LkPrtctrd) use a server in zip format from BSDS, which [I](https://github.com/LkPrtctrd) modified, and which was created by [Ð¡razor](https://github.com/CrazorTheCat) and [risporse](https://github.com/risporce).

1: [Download the server](https://github.com/LkPrtctrd/BSL-V53/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it.

2: Open cmd on your computer and navigate to the server folder.

3: Install TweetnaclCrypto, if you don't have it (navigate to the server folder -> Heart -> Crypto and enter `python setup.py install --user`).

4: Install Heart by typing the command in cmd `pip3 install Heart`

5: Enter `python3 Main.py` and the server is running.
